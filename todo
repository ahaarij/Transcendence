Major module: Designing the Backend as Microservices.
The goal of this major module is to architect the backend of the system using a
microservices approach. Key features and objectives include:
◦ Divide the backend into smaller, loosely-coupled microservices, each responsi-
ble for specific functions or features.
◦ Define clear boundaries and interfaces between microservices to enable inde-
pendent development, deployment, and scaling.
◦ Implement communication mechanisms between microservices, such as REST-
ful APIs or message queues, to facilitate data exchange and coordination.
◦ Ensure that each microservice is responsible for a single, well-defined task or
business capability, promoting maintainability and scalability.
This major module aims to enhance the system’s architecture by adopting a mi-
croservices design approach, enabling greater flexibility, scalability, and maintain-
ability of the backend components.
